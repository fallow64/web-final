        <p>Winter is one of the hardest seasons to make money. You can&#39;t grow any crops, except for Winter Seeds that produce forageables that I wouldn&#39;t really recommend. If you&#39;re into fishing, this is the season for you because your primary method of making money during winter is going to be fishing. If you&#39;re not into fishing, perhaps you should try mining. If you haven&#39;t already started mining, this is the time because you have lots of free time and by the time winter is up you can make sprinklers that automatically water your plants for you.</p>
        <p>Also, one of the things that you would want to do during Winter is upgrading your tools at the Blacksmith. This allows you to have a stronger pickaxe, hoe more spaces with one click, and water more spaces with one click. Winter gives you a lot of downtime where you can get these done. However, you have to go mining in order to get the resources you need.</p>

          <p>Tip: On Winter 25th there is an event called Feast Of The Winter Star, and you are assigned a target to give a gift to. This will give you 5x more hearts than if you give them a gift normally!</p>
